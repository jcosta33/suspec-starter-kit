# Finding: {{title}}

<!-- A generated or agent-proposed finding enters as `candidate`; promoting it to `accepted` (active)
     needs source references (the Evidence section) plus a short rationale — provenance before it is
     trusted. Mark a record `stale` when its `reviewed:` refresh is overdue or its sources no longer
     hold (re-verify to restore it). Mark a suspicious, conflicting, unsupported, or security-sensitive
     record `quarantined` (record the reason); a quarantined record is never retrieved as active. This
     is a conservative-write discipline, not a performance claim. -->
