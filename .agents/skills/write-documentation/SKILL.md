  Implement a documentation task: write or update human-facing docs (README,
  tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation) — one frame held throughout, every
  example run as written, every behavior claim cited to file:line. ALWAYS apply
  when a task packet produces a doc a human (not an agent) reads. Never mix
  frames, hedge with should/might/could, ship unrun examples, or document
  beyond the task's requirements. Skip agent-facing material (guides,
  templates) and all code-changing kinds.

# Implement documentation

Documentation that hedges, ships examples that do not run, or contradicts the code is worse than no
documentation — it misleads, and the reader cannot tell. This guide adds the documentation
discipline on top of the base `implement-task` rules, carrying the Documentarian stance: the reader
is a human who has not read the code, arrived with one question, and the doc answers it. This guide
*is* the documentarian discipline's single home — its load-bearing rules are carried here in full, so
the skill stands alone. These
are conventions the review packet inspects — nothing enforces them at edit time.

This guide is for docs humans read. Agent-facing material (guides, templates, workflow docs) is a
different audience with different conventions, and code-changing work belongs to the other guides
in this kit.

**Before you start, open [`references/task-template.md`](./references/task-template.md)** and copy it
into your task file — it is the session frame for this work; fill it in as you go (don't reconstruct
the structure from memory). It scaffolds the frame, audience, and reader's question, the
examples-to-verify table, pasted evidence, and the self-review. The task packet itself uses the kit's
task template.

## Rules

1. **Fix the frame, the audience, and the question before writing a word.** Exactly one frame:
   **tutorial** (linear, hand-holding, no choices), **how-to** (a recipe for one task), **reference**
   (exhaustive lookup, no narrative), or **explanation** (the why). Name the audience concretely —
   "developers" is not specific; "developers integrating our SDK for the first time" is — and the
   one question the doc answers, stated as the reader would ask it. Discovering mid-doc that you are
   switching frames means it is two docs: split it.
2. **Lead with what the reader needs to do.** The first ~100 words contain the action the reader's
   question asks about — not project history or "before we begin". A reader scanning for an answer
   abandons a doc that buries the action under throat-clearing.
3. **Run every example; capture the output before writing it down.** Execute each example exactly
   as the reader would — no implied setup, no missing imports. An example you did not run is a
   hypothesis, not an example, and it is the most common way documentation lies. Paste the captured
   run as your evidence.
4. **Cite every behavior claim to file:line.** A statement about how the system behaves is
   verifiable against the code — cite the line. If you cannot find the line, the claim is suspect:
   verify it before writing it, or drop it. An uncited behavior claim is indistinguishable from a
   guess, and will be wrong the next time the code moves.
5. **No hedging the reader cannot act on.** "Should", "might", "could" leave the reader unable to
   decide. Either the system does X or it does not; if behavior is conditional, state the
   condition.
6. **Describe requirements as they are.** If the code contradicts what the spec says the doc must
   describe, surface the discrepancy as a blocked question — do not paper over it in prose.
7. **Reconcile the docs this change touches — within the task's scope.** Grep for other docs
   describing the same area; a doc you may edit that now contradicts yours gets reconciled in this
   change, and a contradiction in a doc outside your scope is a finding candidate. A stale doc
   contradicting a fresh one is worse than no doc: the reader cannot tell which is current.
8. **Run the project's format and doc-lint commands on every touched file and paste the output.**
   Resolve commands from `AGENTS.md`; ask when one is undefined. And never write a review result on
   your own work.

| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| An example pasted in without running it          | Run it as written; paste the captured output              |
| "The system does X" with no file:line            | Find the line and cite it, or drop the claim              |
| "Should" / "might" / "could"                     | State the behavior, or the condition under which it holds |
| Mixed frames in one doc                          | Pick one; split the doc if it drifts                      |
| Choices in a tutorial ("you could also try…")    | A tutorial is linear; alternatives go in a how-to         |
| Narrative in a reference ("first, we see that…") | A reference is lookup                                     |
| "While I'm here" polish of neighboring docs      | Finding candidate; document only what the task names      |
| A doc-vs-code discrepancy smoothed over in prose | Blocked question; the spec changes through its own review |

## Gotchas

- **Mixing Diátaxis frames in one doc.** A how-to drifts into explaining the why, or a
  reference grows a hand-holding walkthrough. The reader who came to *do* one task now wades
  through theory, and the reader who came to *understand* hits a recipe — the doc serves
  neither because it answers two questions at once. The drift is the signal it is two docs.
- **Shipping an example that was never run.** You paste a snippet that looks right —
  plausible imports, the obvious call — without executing it. The reader runs it first and
  hits the missing setup or the renamed argument you would have caught. An unrun example is
  a hypothesis, and it is the most common way a doc lies.
- **Hedging with should/might/could.** Unsure whether the behavior is guaranteed, you write
  "this should retry" to stay safe. The reader cannot act on it — does it retry or not? —
  and the hedge hid the one thing they needed: either state the behavior, or state the
  condition under which it holds.
- **Documenting beyond the task's requirements.** A neighboring section looks thin and you
  polish it "while I'm here." That unrequested edit widens the diff past what the task
  named, drags in claims you did not verify against the code, and is an exception trigger at
  review — the extra doc is a finding candidate, not in-scope work.

## Self-review gate

Before declaring the task done:

- [ ] One frame held throughout; audience and reader's question are written down.
- [ ] The first ~100 words contain the action the reader came for.
- [ ] Every example ran as written — self-contained, output captured and pasted.
- [ ] Every behavior claim carries a file:line citation that checks out at this commit.
- [ ] No hedge the reader cannot act on; conditional behavior states its condition.
- [ ] Docs in scope that contradicted this one are reconciled; contradictions out of scope are
      finding candidates. No `TODO`/`FIXME` left behind.
- [ ] Format / doc-lint output is pasted; you issued no review result on your own work.

## Bundled resources

- [`references/task-template.md`](./references/task-template.md) — a working-notes scaffold for the run (frame, audience, reader's
  question; examples-to-verify table; pasted evidence; self-review). The task packet itself uses
  the kit's task template.
