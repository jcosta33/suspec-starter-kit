  Implement a fix task: reproduce the defect, patch the root cause, bind a
  regression test that fails before the patch and passes after, run the full
  suite, paste the evidence. ALWAYS apply when asked to fix, patch, resolve, or
  close a bug, regression, or defect. Never patch the symptom, ship without the
  red-before/green-after transition, or bundle neighboring fixes. Skip writing
  the bug report (diagnosis-only work), behavior-preserving refactors, rewrites —
  and a flaky, non-deterministic failure, which is stabilization work, not a fix.

# Implement a fix

Fixes fail two ways, both producing a green-looking diff that ships the bug. **Patching the
symptom**: suppressing the visible failure while the cause survives, so the defect recurs through a
different path. **A regression test that does not exercise the bug**: one green before the patch
proves nothing, because it stays green if the fix is deleted. This guide adds the fix discipline on
top of the base `implement-task` rules. These are conventions the review packet inspects — nothing
enforces them at edit time.

Writing the bug _report_ is a different job with its own guide in the starter kit's advanced tier
(`write-bug-report`) — this guide consumes a report and produces the fix. A test that fails
_sometimes_ is a different oracle entirely: load `fix-flaky-test`, not this.

**Before you start, open [`references/task-template.md`](./references/task-template.md)** and copy it
into your task file — it is the session frame for this work; fill it in as you go (don't reconstruct
the structure from memory). It scaffolds the reproduction block, the hypothesis trail where each
rejected attempt teaches the next, pasted evidence, and the self-review. The task packet itself uses
the kit's task template.

## Rules

1. **Reproduce the bug in your worktree before you patch.** Re-run the report's reproduction and
   paste the failing output. If you cannot reproduce, do not patch — the discrepancy between your
   environment and the report's is itself a finding (versions, seeds, fixtures, clock, OS), not a
   dismissal. The reproduction is the falsification target for the whole task; without it, "fixed"
   is a claim with no possible counter-evidence.
2. **Patch the root cause, not the symptom.** Before patching, restate in your own words why this
   location is the cause and not merely where the failure became visible; if you cannot, you have
   not root-caused it (see _Hunting the cause_ below). Swallowing the error, clamping the value, or
   special-casing the one triggering input leaves the cause live under a different trigger.
3. **The regression test fails before the fix and passes after.** Patch your fix _out_ (revert it,
   or comment out the path it touches); run the test — it must fail. Restore the fix; run it — it
   must pass. Paste both transitions. A regression test that stays green when the fix is removed is
   a tautology. Assert on the behavior the bug broke — the output, the returned value, the emitted
   event — not on internal state.
4. **Run the full suite, not just the regression test**, and paste the output. A patch that passes
   its own test but breaks a neighbor trades a known bug for an unknown one.
5. **Keep the fix minimal; no bundling.** Bugs have neighbors, and a fix task is the most tempting
   place to "just also fix" the related defect or rename the confusing variable. Don't. Every
   related discovery is a finding candidate in your summary, not a second fix in the diff — a
   one-cause fix is reviewable; a bundle is not.
6. **Record why the patch addresses the cause** in your summary, in one or two sentences. The
   reviewer checks exactly this. "The patch worked" is a verification output, not a reason.
7. **Paste everything; resolve commands from `AGENTS.md`; ask when a command is undefined.** A
   guessed test command produces a false signal about whether the bug is gone. And never write a
   review result on your own work.

## Hunting the cause

Root-causing demands hostility to the first plausible explanation:

- **The first suspicious line is rarely the origin.** Trace from the observable failure back to
  the state-plus-input that produces it; a correlated symptom upstream of the cause is the classic
  false catch.
- **Anchor the cause at file:line, with the state and input that trigger it.** "Somewhere in the
  cache layer" is a symptom location. A cause you cannot anchor, you cannot prove patched.
- **State Expected vs Actual, and Expected by whose authority.** Expected comes from the spec's
  requirement, not your opinion of good behavior. If no requirement covers the broken behavior,
  say so — that coverage gap is itself a finding.
- **"Can't reproduce" is a lead, not an exit.** Vary what the report could not: load, parallel
  siblings, seed, clock, data state. Surface a blocked question if it still will not fire.

## Self-review gate

Before declaring the task done:

- [ ] The pre-patch reproduction output is pasted — the bug fired in _your_ worktree.
- [ ] The regression test's red-then-green transition is pasted (fix patched out, then restored).
- [ ] The full suite ran after your final edit, output pasted.
- [ ] The summary states why the patch addresses the cause, not the symptom.
- [ ] The diff is the minimal fix; related defects are finding candidates, not edits.
- [ ] You issued no review result on your own work.

## Gotchas

Failure modes that show up at run time, not in the rules:

- **You patched the symptom, not the root cause** — swallowed the error, clamped the value, or
  special-cased the one triggering input — so the suite goes green and the cause stays live,
  resurfacing through a different trigger after the task is closed. The first suspicious line is
  usually downstream of the origin; if you cannot restate why this location *is* the cause, you
  have not found it yet.
- **You shipped without the red-before/green-after regression test** — wrote the test after the
  patch and saw it pass, never seeing it fail. A test that is green before the fix exists is a
  tautology that stays green when the fix is deleted, so it guards nothing. Patch the fix out, watch
  it go red, restore the fix, watch it go green.
- **You bundled a neighboring fix** — the confusing variable, the related defect two lines over —
  into the same diff, because a fix task is the most tempting place to "just also fix" the thing
  right next to the bug. Now the reviewer cannot tell which edit closed the reported defect. Each
  neighbor is a finding candidate, not a second fix.

## Bundled resources

- [`references/task-template.md`](./references/task-template.md) — a working-notes scaffold for the run: reproduction block,
  hypothesis trail (each rejected attempt teaches the next), progress checklist, pasted evidence,
  self-review. The task packet itself uses the kit's task template.
