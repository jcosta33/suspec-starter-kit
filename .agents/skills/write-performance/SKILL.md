  Implement a performance task: optimize a measured bottleneck to a numeric
  target — baseline before any edit, identical measurement protocol on both
  sides, one benchmarked change at a time, full suite green after each. ALWAYS
  apply when a task packet optimizes, profiles, or cuts latency / memory / CPU
  / allocations against a metric — or gates a model-quality metric (an
  eval-gated requirement). Never edit before a baseline, mix protocols,
  batch unattributable changes, or accept "make X faster" as the target. Skip
  correctness fixes, refactors, rewrites, migrations, and net-new features.

# Implement a performance change

Performance work fails two ways, both producing a diff that looks like a win: **a number that moved
on the benchmark but not in production** (measured under conditions that don't match where the
system is slow, or against a baseline taken under a different protocol), and **a speedup that
quietly broke correctness** — a faster wrong answer is still a defect. This guide adds the
performance discipline on top of the base `implement-task` rules. These are conventions the review
packet inspects — nothing enforces them at edit time.

Plan the transformation first — the workspace's change plan covers baseline, waves, and rollback;
this guide is the execution half. Numbers, not vibes: nothing is faster until a baseline and a
final figure, under the identical protocol, say so. No number and no protocol is tinkering, not
optimizing — get the target before you start.

**Before you start, open [`references/task-template.md`](./references/task-template.md)** and copy it
into your task file — it is the session frame for this work; fill it in as you go (don't reconstruct
the structure from memory). It scaffolds the baseline block, the target and ceiling, the hypothesis,
the measurement protocol, the per-change ledger, and the self-review. The task packet itself uses the
kit's task template.

## Rules

1. **Measure the baseline before you change any code.** Run the benchmark in your worktree and
   paste the output before touching the implementation. "Improvement" is meaningless without a
   fixed reference point; a baseline reconstructed after the change is unfalsifiable.
2. **The target is a number under named conditions** — "p95 latency of `getQuote()` under 1k RPS
   drops from 240 ms to ≤ 80 ms", not "make X faster". If the task gives only a direction, surface
   a blocked question and get the number first: an unquantified goal is declarable met by any
   change in the right direction, which is how a rounding-error gain ships as done.
3. **State a falsifiable hypothesis and profile to confirm it before optimizing.** "Allocations in
   the hot loop dominate; cutting them 50% should drop latency ≥ 30%" can be disproven; "I think
   this is slow" cannot. Optimizing a path you never profiled is the most common way perf effort
   produces no production gain.
4. **Identical protocol before and after — or the comparison is void.** Warmup, sample count,
   statistical aggregate, hardware, environment, input shape, cache state: record the protocol
   once, reuse it verbatim. A cold baseline against a warm final "proves" a speedup that does not
   exist. If the figure is noisy, run more samples until it is stable — noise is not evidence.
5. **One benchmarked change at a time.** Per iteration: change → re-run the benchmark under the
   protocol → compare → run the full suite. Batched optimizations are unattributable — you cannot
   tell which moved the number, which regressed it, which is dead weight. A second bottleneck found
   mid-task is a finding candidate, not a second edit.
6. **The full suite runs after every change, output pasted.** Performance work does not get to
   skip the suite: the benchmark proves the number moved; only the suite proves you did not break
   what it was measuring. Behavior changed under a "perf" label is a rewrite in disguise — surface
   it.
7. **Document the conditions and honor the ceiling.** Record the input shape, load, hardware, and
   cache state under which the gain holds — the next reader otherwise assumes it is universal. The
   change plan's rollback criteria set the regression ceiling on other metrics; a change that
   breaches it rolls back regardless of the primary gain.
8. **Annotate the clever parts.** If the optimization cost readability, justify the trade against
   the measured gain and leave a call-site comment saying what the unusual structure is for —
   otherwise the next refactor unwinds it and the gain is lost silently.
9. **Paste real output; resolve commands (including the benchmark command) from `AGENTS.md`; ask
   when one is undefined** — a guessed benchmark invocation produces a baseline the final figure
   cannot honestly be compared against. And never write a review result on your own work.

## Self-review gate

Before declaring the task done:

- [ ] The baseline output is pasted and was captured before any code change.
- [ ] The final benchmark is pasted, under the provably identical protocol, against a numeric
      target.
- [ ] Each change was benchmarked individually — you can point at which change moved the number.
- [ ] The full suite ran after every change and after your final edit; output pasted.
- [ ] The conditions under which the gain holds are recorded; no other metric breached the
      ceiling.
- [ ] Readability costs are annotated at the call site; second bottlenecks are finding candidates.
- [ ] You issued no review result on your own work.

## Model-quality metrics — the stochastic delta

An eval-gated requirement (NDCG, accuracy, win rate) runs the same discipline with one delta:
the measurement is stochastic, so pin the protocol — seed or fixed dataset/holdout, metric,
threshold — and state a variance budget (N runs, the aggregate).
Evidence is the eval-run link or output under the same pinned protocol on both sides. The
rules above apply unchanged; the Skip list still excludes net-new feature work.

## Gotchas

- **Edited before taking a baseline.** Code changed before the benchmark ran, so the reference point
  is reconstructed after the fact and unfalsifiable — "improvement" has nothing fixed to measure
  against. Run the benchmark and paste its output before touching the implementation.
- **Mixed measurement protocols across the two sides.** The baseline was cold and the final warm (or
  different sample counts, host, input shape, cache state), so the comparison "proves" a speedup
  that does not exist. Record the protocol once and reuse it verbatim on both sides; if the figure
  is noisy, add samples rather than trusting it.
- **Batched unattributable changes so no single one is credited.** Several optimizations landed in
  one change, so you cannot tell which moved the number, which regressed it, and which is dead
  weight carried forward as risk. One benchmarked change at a time, full suite after each; a second
  bottleneck is a finding candidate, not a second edit.
