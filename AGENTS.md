# AGENTS.md

<!-- Keep this file short — aim for ~100 lines (Suspec's own convention: agents read
     it on every task, so every line spends always-loaded budget). Move procedures
     into the guides; keep only standing facts and commands here. -->

## Suspec startup

1. Read the task packet you were given first; for 1:1 work with no task, read the
   spec directly. Follow its scope.
2. Read the linked spec (and change plan, if any) before touching code.
3. Do not implement behavior outside scope — if a requirement can't be
   met as written, stop and say why instead of improvising.
4. Run every Verify item (the spec's, or the task's `## Verify` for a split
   slice) and paste the real output. A claim without output counts as unverified.
5. Before finishing, re-read your own diff as a skeptic, record the run — for 1:1
   work fill the spec's `## Execution` section, for a split task the task's
   `## Run summary` (changed files, per-command results citing the Verify pastes,
   out-of-scope edits, blocked questions) — and route the work for independent
   review. Use the `review-ready` board state only when the work has a task row.

## Workspace

- The loop: Pull → Spec → Run → Review → Close (+ Task when split, + Inventory / Change Plan for
  structural work).
- Specs: `specs/<feature>/spec.md` · tasks: `tasks/` · reviews: `reviews/` ·
  findings: `findings/` · intake: `intake/` · inventories: `inventory/` ·
  change plans: `change-plans/` · decisions: `decisions/` · board: `status.md`
- Templates for the core artifacts: `templates/` (incl. the ADR shape, `adr.md`)
- Agent guides: `.agents/skills/` — Claude Code reads them via the `.claude/skills`
  symlink; point other tools at the same folder
- {{For code repos: "Suspec workspace: ../<project>-works"}}

## Project facts

- {{stack, runtimes, package manager}}
- {{architecture rules an agent cannot infer}}
- {{house conventions that differ from defaults}}

## Commands

<!-- The commands an agent runs to verify work in this repo. Nothing executes them
     automatically today — you, your agent, CI, or suspec-cli does. -->

| Slot | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| cmdTest | `{{npm test / pytest / …}}` | run the test suite |
| cmdLint | `{{eslint / ruff / …}}` | static checks |
| cmdBuild | `{{build command}}` | production build |
| cmdTypecheck | `{{tsc --noEmit / mypy}}` | types |

An empty or missing slot means **ask** — never invent a command. A Verify item
whose command cannot be resolved reads Unverified, not Pass.

Monorepo with a root dispatcher (`turbo run test`, `make test`): keep single
slots. Where contexts truly diverge (polyglot or multi-repo estates), repeat
this table once per context under a sub-heading (`### Commands (web)`) — slot
names stay the same; a task resolves against the sub-table its Affected areas
name. More slots (registry: `checks/checks.yaml` in the Suspec repo):
cmdInstall, cmdFormat, cmdValidate, cmdBenchmark, cmdSecurity — add a row when
your estate has one.

<!-- SOL-form `VERIFY BY <method>:<adapter>:<artifact>` lines resolve their adapter
     against these slot names (cmdTest, cmdLint, …). Keep the cmd prefix.
     Dedicated workspace repo: these name the commands of the code repos this
     workspace governs — leave placeholders until that's decided. The "For code
     repos" line above is what you copy OUT to each code repo, then remove here. -->

## Agent role

You are an implementation or review worker. Suspec organizes the work; you perform
the assigned task — and you never review your own implementation.

Write economically: evidence first, structure over prose, no filler — but clarity
outranks brevity (keep full prose for safety notes, confirmations, and ordered steps).
