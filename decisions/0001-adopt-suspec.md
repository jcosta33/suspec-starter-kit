# 0001 — Adopt Suspec for this workspace

## Context

{{team}} uses coding agents for a growing share of its changes. The code
arrives faster than we can specify and review it: requirements live in ticket
threads, agents get prompted from memory, and "done" claims reach review
without evidence.

## Decision

This repository is our Suspec workspace:

- Durable intent lives in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`; supporting docs sit
  beside it.
- The committed record is `specs/`, `findings/`, `decisions/`, and `status.md`
  (the board). `intake/`, `tasks/`, and `reviews/` are a gitignored ephemeral
  working set (ADR-0104) — their durable residue lives in the spec's
  `## Execution`, in `findings/`, and in the merged PR.
- Every agent task starts from a task packet; every result is judged through
  a review packet — a Pass needs pasted output, a CI link, or, for a manual
  check, a named human's recorded observation.
- Decisions land here in `decisions/`, numbered and immutable.
- Code repositories stay pristine: they hold code; this workspace holds
  intent and evidence.

## Consequences

- Reviews read coverage tables and routed exceptions instead of raw diffs.
- The workspace grows with every task — that record is the point, not clutter.
- These rules are conventions; the team holds them in review, not a tool.
